{"license":"GPL-2.0 WITH Classpath-exception-2.0","opinion":0,"packname":"","patent":0,"pattern":"+If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n+possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n+free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\n+terms.\n+\n+To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\n+attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n+convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n+the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n+\n+    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n+    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n+\n+    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or\n+    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\n+    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the\n+    License, or (at your option) any later version.\n+\n+    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n+    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n+    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
