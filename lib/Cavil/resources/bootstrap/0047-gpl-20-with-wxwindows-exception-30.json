However, you are prevented from\nrestricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the\nrights to use or distribute wxWindows library source code in the way\nintended.\n\nThe wxWindows Licence establishes the copyright for the code and related\nmaterial, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\/or\nmodify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors\nfor this or derived code.\n\nThe core distribution of the wxWindows library contains files\nunder two different licences:\n\n- Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public\n  Licence, version 2, with the special exception that you may create and\n  distribute object code versions built from the source code or modified\n  versions of it (even if these modified versions include code under a\n  different licence), and distribute such binaries under your own\n  terms.\n\n- Most core wxWindows manuals are made available under the \"wxWindows\n  Free Documentation Licence\", which allows you to distribute modified\n  versions of the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications\n  made by you in your version of the library. However, you may not restrict\n  any third party from reincorporating your changes into the original\n  manuals.\n","trademark":0},{"opinion":0,"patent":0,"pattern":"                wxWindows Library Licence, Version 3\n                ====================================\n\n  Copyright (c) $SKIP19\n\n  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n  of this licence document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                       WXWINDOWS LIBRARY LICENCE\n     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n  \n  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and\/or modify it\n  under the terms of the GNU Library General Public Licence as published by\n  the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the Licence, or (at\n  your option) any later version.\n  \n  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
