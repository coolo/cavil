Now I wish I could write as long lines as some github projects do - one badge here, one badge there as if they had no other hobby than collecting badges for things github displays.

But sometimes they also just contain long URLS to https://build.opensuse.org/package/view_file/system:install:head/patterns-base/patterns-base.spec?expand=1 - then there is little we can do about it.
